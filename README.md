# Fender wraps Jetty

A functional DSL for configuring Jetty.

This was the subject of a talk at ScalaSyd.  Slides here: http://notes.backgroundsignal.com/Fender.html

If you are creating a functional DSL for some set of POJOs other than Jetty copy Builders.scala and Syntax.scala as a starting point.
